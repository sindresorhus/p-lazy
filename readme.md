# p-lazy

> Create a lazy promise that defers execution until it's awaited or when `.then()`, or `.catch()`, or `.finally()` is called

Useful if you're doing some heavy operations and would like to only do it when the promise is actually used.

## Install

```sh
npm install p-lazy
```

## Usage

```js
import PLazy from 'p-lazy';

const lazyPromise = new PLazy(resolve => {
	someHeavyOperation(resolve);
});

// `someHeavyOperation` is not yet called

await doSomethingFun;

// `someHeavyOperation` is called
console.log(await lazyPromise);
```

## API

### new PLazy(executor)

Same as the [`Promise` constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). `PLazy` is a subclass of `Promise`.

### PLazy.from(fn)

Create a `PLazy` promise from a promise-returning or async function.

### PLazy.resolve(value)

Create a `PLazy` promise that is resolved with the given `value`, or the promise passed as `value`.

### PLazy.reject(reason)

Create a `PLazy` promise that is rejected with the given `reason`.
